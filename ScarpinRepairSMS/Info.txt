Auto Repair Shop Application (Jetpack Compose)

Fully implemented a responsive user interface for various Android devices based on the provided design, using Jetpack Compose.

Assisted the lead developer in resolving issues and refining different parts of the project by identifying problems and proposing effective solutions.

Reviewed and tested the application logic to ensure correct behavior in customer onboarding, customer approval/rejection, and customer list management features.

Responsibilities included UI development, responsive layout implementation, logic testing, and providing technical guidance to the team’s developer.

This experience highlights my strengths in problem-solving, technical mentorship, UI optimization, and validating application business logic.
