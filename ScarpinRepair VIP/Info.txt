Auto Repair Shop Management System (Kotlin / XML)

Fully implemented the car parts management module, including tracking part usage based on driven mileage, vehicle checkout processing, and inventory management.

Designed and developed the accounting module, covering product returns, generation of detailed invoices upon customer checkout, and invoice calculations based on both in-stock and purchased parts.

Implemented high-quality invoice printing on A5 paper with a clean and professional layout.

Developed a wallet system to manage customer payments and settlements.

My responsibilities covered all operations related to car parts, vehicle checkout, inventory, accounting, invoicing, and the wallet system, while customer management and messaging features were implemented by a teammate.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex management systems, internal accounting logic, technical vehicle data visualization, and a complete end-to-end user experience in Android applications.
