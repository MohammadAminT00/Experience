Designed a fully responsive UI for all tablets and kiosks, and independently developed the complete Android application for cafés, restaurants, and sandwich shops using Flutter.

Implemented user registration and management, providing a fully customizable experience tailored to each store.

Enabled adding and managing food items and ingredients with detailed information such as components (e.g., beef, lettuce, mayonnaise) and images for each item and category.

Provided full customization options for each store, including application theme, logo, store name, and contact information.

Developed a customer ordering system allowing item quantity selection and final order submission.

Implemented order receipt generation and printing for all printer-connected devices, including order details, total amount, store name, address, and contact number.

This project demonstrates strong capabilities in designing and developing point-of-sale systems, data management, UI customization, and hardware interaction (printers).
